# NYC-GreenTaxi-Challenge

This repository contains an analysis of data collected about Green Taxis (taxis that are not allowed to run in densely populated areas of Manhattan). The code is written in R and the pdf report displays the output of the Rmd file. The data can be found at:
http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

This analysis was a data challenge and the format of the report/code is in accordance with it.
